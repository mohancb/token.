# token.
Create a smart contract using which only one authorized person can deposit tokens. The other parties can just withdraw the amount. Withdrawal limit should be validated. Withdrawal can't exceed the available balance of tokens. Basically the father deposits, and the son/daughter can only withdraw. There is no deposit functionality for the son/daughter.
